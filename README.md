## Project Wtiteup

### Implementation

Implementing this project was not very difficult, especially after implementing Kalman and particle filters in preceding projects.

It also helped that I practiced and implemented the algorithm in Python when going through lesson taught by Sebastian.

In code, I decided to add an additional variable `dt` that can later be used to accomodatie different time intervals, and also because my mathematical other side could not tolerate not using `dt` updating derivative and integral of cross-track error.

I also added a class method that takes total error and returns steering angle, and also checks that it is within the given range of `[-1,1]`.

Apart from this I do not think there is anything especially interesting in my implementation.

### Tuning Parameters of PID Controller

I spent quite some time tuning the parameters by hand. I decided to not implement the twiddle algorithm.

My general approach was similar to what was taught in class.

I initially tuned only the P parameter, essentially making it a P-controller. I noticed that a large value led to an increasing oscillation of the car around the center of the road. I found values of `0.1-0.2` to work well at throttle `0.3`.

I then fixed `Kp` at `0.2` and started tuning the `Kd` parameter, essentially implementing PD-controller. I noticed that small values similar to `Kp` did not make a big difference and then tried `1.0`, followed by `10.0`, which made the car very responsive. I was satisfied with results.

I then proceeded to tune the last parameter, `Ki`, essentially implementing PID-controller. I found that even small value can lead to unpredictable oscillation during sharp turns, even though on straights and slight turns it worked nice. I was going down by the factor of `10` and finally settled down at `0.0001`.

Then I played with throttle and these parameters worked up to throttle level of `0.5`, which left me satisfied. I then returned to the default value before submitting the project.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
